DECISION: Choose Approach for Email Signature and Shortlink

Bottom Line Up Front

Purpose: DECISION:

We need to decide on the email signature design and the shortlink structure for the two editions of the book. Options include a call to action with a shortlink or a shortlink tree leading to individual assets.

Hi Hannah,

I was thinking about the conference call yesterday. 

Some thoughts:

- Do you still want to go ahead with the email signature idea? If so, I would recommend sending it out for design today. 

The typical format would be a call to action with the shortlink.

However ... as we're looking at publishing two editions (on Amazon UK and US) I would actuallly recommend that we link to a short link tree which I would be happy to create. 

These are basically slim landing pages with buttons linking on to individaul assets. 

If so, I can implement any variations on this theme:

book.hannah.com
hannah.com/buy-book

Etc

Let me know your preferences and I can get a wireframe over to you later.

Best,

Daniel
